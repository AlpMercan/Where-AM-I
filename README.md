# Where-AM-I
Open_CV based solution to kidnapped robot problem. It will detect kidnapping from IMU and the relocalize itself.
# How to use it
cd catkin_ws/src #wherever your main is
git clone https://github.com/AlpMercan/Where-AM-I.git
cd ~catkin_ws
rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-srcÂ -r
catkin_make
#some configurations
#Use the correct imu topic
#change your map.yaml's origin to [0,0,0]
#the global costmap and local cost map should be in the same directory
#first enter the The_kidnapper_Algorithm.py and change image path and template path to your respective position
#from map class change the global cost map topic with its name and after work the system 2 times. 
#After you have initial costmaps change back to local costmaps.
#You can add the kidnapper.launch to your main launch file for it to work continously.
#As long as it does not detect kidnapping, the main program will not work so CPU usage is respectively low
